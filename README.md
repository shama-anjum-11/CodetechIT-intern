**OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECTS:**

**TASK 1 :**
HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION USING LINEAR REGRESSION:

**Project Description**:  
A house price prediction system that uses a linear regression model to estimate house prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities. The model was developed in Python and implemented on Google Colab.

**Technologies Used**:  
- Python  
- Google Colab  
- Linear Regression (Machine Learning)  
- Pandas (for data manipulation)  
- NumPy (for numerical computations)  
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)  
- scikit-learn (for model implementation and evaluation)  

**TASK 2:** TEXT TO IMAGE GENERATOR:

**Project Description**:  
An image-to-text generator that converts visual content into descriptive text. The system leverages the Stable Diffusion model via Hugging Face for accurate and coherent text generation from images. It was implemented using Python on Google Colab.

**Technologies Used**:  
- Python  
- Google Colab  
- Hugging Face API  
- Stable Diffusion Model  
- Transformers Library (for model integration)  
- PIL (Python Imaging Library) for image processing  
- NumPy (for data handling)
